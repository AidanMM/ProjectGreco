@1This is our first test of loading in font so that we can easily tell the dialouge box what, where and when it should load things in! I think it is a pretty cool feature, but hey, if you don't agree then maybe you simply just shouldn't play again.  You know what, screw it, I do not want to play, I just don't! Oh well, whatever, I don't need you, stop playing the game!
@2Oh, so you are back, just back back back.  Did you decide that you want to play?  Well that was a bad choice, beacause, like, this game does not want you to play anymore, like at all. Just stop. Please. Do. Not. Play
@3Anyway, this is a level! You can jump around and stuff. It is pretty fun.
@4This is the skill Tree! How cool!
@5Seriously though, HOW FREAKING COOL IS THIS! LIKE, CAN YOU EVEN HANDLE THIS RIGHT NOW!?!?!?!?! I CAN'T. REALLY, I CAN'T!!!!!! <(0_0<)
